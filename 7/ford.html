      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">A train advances towards 
        us, drawn by a steam locomotive, and slows down at the end of the platform 
        of a small station. This image makes us think of <i>L'arriv&eacute;e d'un 
        train &agrave; la Ciotat</i> (1895) but, in this introductory shot of 
        John Ford’s <i>Doctor Bull</i> (1933), the train whistle blows several 
        times. We will re-find this sober railway setting at the start of <i>The 
        Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> (1962); but does the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> 
        of that twilight Western rest upon the same narrative principle as in 
        the first instalment of the Will Rogers trilogy shot by Ford for Fox? 
        (1)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">At first glance, <i>The 
        Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> confirms the classical rule of construction. 
        The film begins with a train carrying a Senator (James Stewart) and his 
        wife (Vera Miles) from the capitol to this little Western town; and it 
        ends with their departure. This white-haired couple have come for the 
        funeral of a friend; the political man’s memories of what he experienced 
        in this town unfold in flashback. The train’s arrival is thus indispensable 
        to the film’s narrative organisation. In <i>Dr Bull</i>, by contrast, 
        the train plays a purely anecdotal role, since no character alights from 
        it. The narrative mechanism works on a different level. In the film’s 
        opening shot, the train carries a single object: a black postal bag suddenly 
        thrown from the carriage, landing brusquely. The close-up of this mail 
        bag on the ground begins the narration, and prefigures the shot of the 
        bank bag thrown by Doc Holliday (Victor Mature) as a farewell gesture 
        to Chihuahua (Linda Darnell) in <i>My Darling Clementine</i> (1946).</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In <i>Dr Bull</i>, 
        we do not see who throws the bag. A postal worker picks it up and carries 
        it to the office. The chat then shared among colleagues introduces the 
        character of Dr Bull. Likewise at the end: a train stops at the station, 
        filmed from the same angle. This time, a white mail bag is thrown from 
        the carriage. The identical action of <i>throwing</i> thus organises the 
        film’s narrative progression. The postal worker informs the controller 
        that the country doctor is about to make a great scientific discovery. 
        Dr Bull will take the train for this night ride with his new wife. The 
        film ends on the image of the departing train; but, on the narrative level, 
        it is really the throwing of the mail bag which closes the story. The 
        resemblance between <i>Dr Bull</i> and <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> 
        is thus more than merely superficial.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><br>
        Collective Motion</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">It is specific to Ford 
        to show us the image of a bag being thrown rather than a train arriving 
        or departing. The bag has no particular meaning, but the fact that it 
        is thrown plays a role in the narration. Let us designate this gesture 
        of throwing as a <i>theme</i> which, through its repetition, articulates 
        the narrative structure of the films, whatever their genre. The signification 
        of the throwing theme varies from one film to the next. It is a unifying 
        element, making analogous moments from different films correspond. On 
        the narrative level, this theme marks sometimes an opening, sometimes 
        a rupture. It sets off, speeds up or slows down the course of the narrative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In <i>Steamboat ‘Round 
        the Bend</i> (1935), the last instalment of the Will Rogers trilogy, the 
        collective throwing of objects has the function of announcing the film’s 
        denouement. The narrative is organised according to that well-known Griffithian 
        system, a last-minute rescue. An innocent young man, accused of murder, 
        awaits hanging. His fianc&eacute;e, encouraged by her prospective uncle, 
        a seller of snakeoil, looks for a witness to to save her lover from the 
        scaffold. She finds this person, and takes him on the uncle’s boat destined 
        for city hall. Time is pressing, but the Mississippi is blocked by a boating 
        competition. The Uncle decides to participate in it but, alas, his steamboat 
        slows down half-way, lacking fuel. Rogers then orders the crew to start 
        throwing objects. So the representative Fordian figures of the ‘30s – 
        Francis Ford, Stepin Fetchit, Berton Churchill – throw everything flammable 
        into the engine: tables, chairs, deck lumber, wax dolls … even the medicine 
        bottles, which are really full of rum! With each bottle, the flames rise 
        enormously. The boat quickens and arrives safe and sound. This absurdly 
        funny water-race sequence is worthy of the Marx Brothers (in <i>Go West</i> 
        [1940], the Marx Brothers destroy their wagons in order to hurl the debris 
        into a locomotive engine.) The throwing theme is decisive on the narrative 
        level; this collective action saves the innocent young man.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">The example of <i>Steamboat 
        ‘Round the Bend</i> prompts us to reflect on the throwing theme: on the 
        thrower and on the object thrown, when and to what end. Collective throwing, 
        although rare, creates typically Fordian situations. In <i>How Green Was 
        My Valley</i> (1941), the family members throw their salaries into the 
        mother’s huge apron. Collective throwing as a family ritual can be found 
        in a completely opposite context in <i>Tobacco Road</i> (1941), where 
        the decline of farmers during the Great Depression is symbolised by the 
        brutality of the unemployed son throwing a baseball against the wall of 
        the wooden house. The starving family members, cued by a silent signal 
        from the mother, throw rocks at the house of son-in-law (Ward Bond) in 
        order to steal his turnips. Like in a military operation, they each carry 
        a large rock and silently approach the young man who has been seduced 
        by the girl in the family (Gene Tierney). Thanks to this collective rock 
        throwing, they succeed in getting some turnips. This sequence devoted 
        to human misery is transformed into an optimistic scene close to light 
        comedy. Is it because of the magic of the Fordian theme of throwing?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Another collective 
        hurl: in <i>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</i> (1949), the veteran cavalry Sergeant 
        (Victor McLaglen), about to retire, drinks Irish whiskey under the eyes 
        of a debonair barman (Francis Ford). On the same day, Captain Bristol 
        (John Wayne) quits the army for good. The Sergeant, in civilian dress, 
        fights off the blows from the colleagues who have come to arrest him (he 
        will enter the security section of the prison). In their rather battered 
        state, the soldiers accept the Sargeant’s proposition to drink in celebration 
        of the Captain’s departure. In their glee, they throw their glasses at 
        the window, the barman hurls his whiskey bottle and the Sergeant sends 
        a soldier of small stature to the wall. This improvised farewell ceremony 
        is scarcely military in nature!</font><b> </b></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><i><br>
        Pure Movement</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In Ford, throwing an 
        object does not only represent a collective, anti-conformist ritual at 
        the core of a rigid community. This thematic, repeated right throughout 
        his career, takes on varied significations and functions. The characters, 
        regardless of their class, race or gender, express their emotions by throwing 
        anything that comes into their hands – sometimes purposelessly so. Thus, 
        in <i>Fort Apache</i> (1948), when the cavalry captain (John Wayne), accompanied 
        by an ex-officer from the South (Pedro Armandaris) throws a whiskey bottle 
        into a ravine, his act of throwing traces a glorious movement in space. 
        It is the same when the deserter (Ben Johnson) in <i>Rio Grande</i> (1950), 
        descending at a gallop down the cliff, throws a can. Both scenes occur 
        within the desert lanscape of Monument Valley. Through its beauty, the 
        movement of the thrown object makes us momentarily forget narrative logic. 
        We know the provenance of the bottle and the can, but the suddenness of 
        the throw, in isolation, catches us unawares. The act of throwing, as 
        a theme, functions here by surprise. We note that it comes at the end 
        of a sequence in <i>Fort Apache</i> while, in <i>Rio Grande</i>, it marks 
        the beginning. Ford’s genius is demonstrated in such unexpected but indispensable 
        <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>. Ben Johnson throwing his gun into the distance 
        in <i>Wagon Master</i> (1950) is also inscribed in this context.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">It is at the level 
        of such thematic surprise that we discover a very fine moment in the Civil 
        War episode of <i>How The West Was Won</i> (1962). The Southern soldier 
        (George Peppard) returns to the farm where he was born and learns that 
        his parents died during the war. We see the image of his younger brother 
        throwing a bucket of water in the yard where a tree casts shade. This 
        gesture represents, in its casualness, an affectionate welcome for the 
        older brother. Similar to the thrown mail bag which in <i>Dr Bull</i> 
        opened and closed the narrative, the thrown water bucket (like the can 
        and whisky bottle), lacking symbolic meaning, plays the narrative role 
        of kicking off a final scene in an improvised manner.</font></p>

        recourse to the throwing theme at the most decisive moments – even if 
        critics have never noticed it. Tellingly, one of the rare commentraries 
        to allude to the mail bag thrown from the train in <i>Dr Bull</i> comes 
        from a filmmaker, Jean-Marie Straub. In an interview with Charles Tesson, 
        he declared:</font></p>

      you look at the way the film establishes a little provincial town – the 
      arriving train, the bag of letters on the platform, the girl who comes for 
      the post – it’s only an hour later that you understand why. The entire establishing

      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">We should note that 
        Straub is sensitive neither to the subject nor the story of the film, 
        but to <i>pure actions</i> (‘the arriving train, the bag of letters on 
        the platform, the girl who comes for the post’). Ford’s <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> 
        does not resort to a psychological and narrative logic, but to a succession 
        of isolated gestures. The term <i>documentary</i> used to describe the 
        ‘establishing ... of this little provincial town’ is applied precisely 
        to the succession of neutral, everyday gestures ritualised by virtue of 
        this neutrality. The throwing theme is visible, but what is specific to 
        this filmmaker is rarely perceived.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Wherein the necessity 
        of reflecting upon what we call Ford’s style. It is true that the documentary 
        label for rural life in <i>Dr Bull</i> is not applicable to the river 
        race in <i>Steamboat ‘Round the Bend</i>. Following Straub, we can pose 
        the question: what is there in common between the three Will Rogers films 
        produced by Fox and the films made almost simultaneously by Ford for RKO, 
        <i>The Lost Patrol</i> (1934) and <i>The Informer</i> (1935)?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">The Fox films have 
        no pretension. Ford is content merely to assemble them. By contrast, in 
        <i>The Lost Patrol</i> and especially <i>The Informer</i>, the auteur 
        shows an aesthetic, even political, ambition. The lighting of the small 
        provincial town in <i>Dr Bull</i> contrasts with the nocturnal scene of 
        Expressionist shadows in Dublin, reconstituted in the studio for <i>The 
        Informer</i>. There is nothing dramatic in the description of ‘populist’ 
        medicine in a rural community, compared to the tearing inner conflict 
        of the Irish proletarian. If one were not familiar with Ford’s filmography, 
        it would be heard to believe that these two films were made by the same 
        director. But our thematic perspective allows us to recognise what connects 
        them. Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) in <i>The Informer</i> is presented 
        to us like other Fordian characters: throwing away a cigarette butt. Noticing, 
        in the night, his girlfriend being harassed by a shady character, he throws 
        his cigarette over his shoulder before approaching them. Gypo pushes the 
        man to the ground but his gesture is misplaced, for his girlfriend loses 
        a client. He will die because of her, after having denounced a comrade. 
        The throwing theme here acquires a tragic hue.</font><b> </b></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><i><br>
        Smoking/Throwing</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Of course, there are 
        a thousand ways to film characters smoking – something that appears in 
        virtually every movie. In Ford, however, people smoke at decisive moments. 
        No one throws away his matches, cigarettes or cigars with as much perserverance 
        as in his work. In <i>How The West Was Won</i>, during the discussion 
        between General Sherman (John Wayne) and General Grant (Henry Morgan) 
        on the obligations of war, we find it natural that they smoke a cigar. 
        Wayne smokes for the sole purpose of power, throwing his cigar to the 
        ground in a rage. It is clear that Ford made Wayne redo Harry Carey’s 
        gesture of throwing away his cigarettes at each significant narrative 
        moment when he played the role of Chayenne Harry in silent Universal Westerns.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In <i>The Quiet Man</i> 
        (1953), the ex-boxer (Wayne) returns to the countryside. Close to a forest 
        he lights a cigarette, seeming to obey some ritual. Just at the moment 
        of throwing away his match, he perceives, through the trees, Maureen O’Hara, 
        leading her sheep on the grassy slope. It is as if, in lighting his cigarette, 
        he has provoked the apparition of this dreamlike creature. His gesture 
        of throwing away the match remains suspended, and he is immobilised, awestruck. 
        He will return to smoking only when the young woman has disappeared.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Lighting a cigarette 
        involves something more than simply smoking. In the Fordian thematic configuration, 
        it implies the action of throwing, and has the narrative effect of calling 
        up an erotic feminine presence. Wayne in <i>The Quiet Man</i> is evidence 
        of this constant. McLaglen throwing his cigarette butt in <i>The Informer</i> 
        is equally subject to the narrative effect of this quasi-automatic act. 
        The thematic manifestation of throwing thus provokes starkly different 
        consequences: benign in <i>The Quiet Man</i>, malign in <i>The Informer</i>. 
        This ambiguity insures thematic regularity, since throwing governs equally 
        the appearance or the disappearance of a beloved being.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">It also happens that 
        a Fordian hero lights his cigarette when he must renounce a female presence. 
        Thus, at the end of <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i>, Wayne, having 
        taken the place of his friend James Stewart and killed an outlaw, decides 
        to separate from Vera Miles, for whom he feels something more than friendship. 
        The setting is nocturnal like Dublin in <i>The Informer</i>, and Wayne’s 
        silhouette moves away from a wall in shadow. He throws away his still-burning 
        match. This throwing gesture is like a farewell sign; he will henceforth 
        ruin his life with booze.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">The cigarette can be 
        an interchangeable thematic detail. What matters is the act of throwing, 
        not the replaceable object. Lighting a lamp can lead to a narrative situation 
        similar to lighting a cigarette. In <i>How Green Was My Valley</i>, when 
        the priest played by Walter Pidgeon returns to his room and lights the 
        lamp, he is surprised by the presence in the dark of Maureen O’Hara, who 
        has come to say goodbye. Transfixed like Wayne in <i>The Quiet Man</i>, 
        the priest suspends his gesture of throwing the match over his shoulder, 
        the same gesture carried out by the Irish hero in <i>The Informer</i>. 
        In <i>Rio Grande</i>, we find again this shadow-and-light game staging 
        the emergence of a female body. When cavalry officer Wayne returns to 
        his tent, he lights a lamp with a match that he throws on the ground. 
        Suddenly his wife (O’Hara) emerges. Their fleeting embrace confirms the 
        throwing thematic.</font><b> </b></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><i><br>
        Varieties</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In this thematic perspective, 
        throwing does not necessarily imply a narrative consequence. The theme 
        sometimes provokes a burlesque effect, like the enormous custard pie collected 
        by Wayne in <i>The Wings of Eagles</i> (1957), the whiskey and the chair 
        thrown by Wayne and Lee Marvin in <i>Donovan’s Reef</i> (1963), or the 
        chewing tobacco that veteran Francis Ford happily directs into the court 
        spitoon in <i>Judge Priest</i> (1934). This spit being invisible, the 
        filmmaker uses a sound effect. During the defence prosecutor’s speech, 
        this spitoon noise deflates the solemn institutional discourse. Similarly 
        for the diligent coachman (Francis Ford) who spits before a high ranking 
        officer (Henry Fonda) in <i>Fort Apache</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">When it comes to objects 
        destined for movement, like the acrobat’s knife in the scene of prison 
        recreation in <i>Up the River</i> (1930), the act of throwing engenders 
        no narrative effect. There is nothing extraordinary about such a performer 
        (played by Spencer Tracy) throwing a knife. It is natural for an American 
        soldier on the World War One battlefield to throw grenades, as James Cagney 
        does in <i>What Price Glory?</i> (1952). The situation is less natural 
        when the throwing theme has a metonymic function. Compare the battle scene 
        in Ford’s colour version of <i>What Price Glory?</i> to the corresponding 
        scene in Raoul Walsh’s silent, black and white 1926 version. In Ford, 
        war is symbolised by a single scene of grenade throwing, in a near-abstract, 
        artificial set lit in an almost Expressionist manner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">One can understand 
        why Ford adapated the celebrated play <i>Mister Roberts</i> – written 
        by Thomas Heggen and Joshua Logan, and performed on Broadway by Henry 
        Fonda – for the screen. Without rehashing the split between director and 
        actor over this project, we can imagine that Ford was interested, above 
        all, in two key moments of the play that feature spectacular throwing. 
        While not knowing which of the three directors – Ford, Mervin LeRoy who 
        replaced him, or Joshua Logan – shot the scenes in which Fonda and Lemmon 
        throw the Captain’s pot plants into the sea, we can be almost certain 
        that this hybrid film is signed John Ford because of this repetition of 
        the act of throwing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Two television films 
        made in the 1950s and ‘60s, both with baseball as their subject, recount 
        the misadventures of a star far from the stadium, falsely accused of having 
        received casks of wine. Ford does not show any player throwing the ball 
        – for this particular act of throwing has no meaning for him. Note, by 
        contrast, how the memory of two players remains inscribed in the mass 
        public’s memory because of their characteristic way of throwing. In <i>Rookie 
        of the Year</i> (1955), it is not a ball but a bat which is thrown. A 
        sports reporter (John Wayne) comments on the way that the rookie throws 
        his bat away after each failed play, uncovering the family link between 
        the young debutant and a celebrated player (Ward Bond) now in retirement. 
        In <i>Flashing Spikes</i> (1962), another player (James Stewart), split 
        from the professional league, saves a young hopeful who has been unjustly 
        accused. His identity is spotted because of his habitual gesture of plucking 
        up courage, taking a little dirt and throwing it over his shoulder. For 
        Ford, it is the <i>eloquence of gesture</i> which prevails.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In emotional situations, 
        characters throw anything which comes into their hands. At the end of 
        <i>Arrowsmith</i> (1931), the humanitarian doctor (Ronald Colman) throws 
        his whiskey glass against a wall as he decides to adopt a new life. In 
        <i>Drums Along the Mohawk</i> (1939), an Indian, tired of the interminable 
        chase through forests and valleys, hurls his spear at the silhouette of 
        Henry Fonda disappearing over the horizon. In shame and disappointment, 
        having failed his final mission, John Wayne throws his hat down on the 
        desk of his Commander (George O’Brien) in <i>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</i>. 
        For Fonda this will be a joyful gesture, as he throws his hat into the 
        air after inviting Cathy Downs to dance with him in <i>My Darling Clementine</i>. 
        Wayne, accompanied by Maureen O’Hara, will perform this same gesture even 
        more spectacularly in <i>The Quiet Man</i>, confirming that the act of 
        throwing illuminates each film differently. In a dramatic context, Thomas 
        Mitchell, struck by a thrown object on fire, will fall down dead at the 
        end of <i>The Long Voyage Home</i> (1940).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Thus, the drunken doctor 
        (Mitchell) in <i>Stagecoach</i> (1939) throws his whiskey at the chimney 
        to express his distrust of the banker (Berton Churchill). The flames fanned 
        by the alcohol visually translate his emotion. In <i>The Searchers</i> 
        (1956), the old Southerner (John Wayne) expresses his edginess by performing 
        the same gesture in a Mexican restaurant, but in a more striking way – 
        it is a colour film – in front of his nephew who is finishing a meal. 
        In <i>Rio Grande</i>, upset at not having understood the word ‘arsonist’ 
        uttered by Maureen O’Hara, Victor McLaglen throws a bucket in the river. 
        In <i>My Darling Clementine</i>, Victor Mature, in despair, throws his 
        empty glass at the medical certificate hanging on the wall. At the bar 
        in <i>The Horse Soldiers</i> (1959), after the battle with the Southerners, 
        the Colonel (Wayne) will take furious recourse to throwing his whisky 
        glass at a colleague (Willis Bouchey) who, among the wounded, had thought 
        only of his own career.</font><b> </b></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><i><br>
        Solo and Solidarity</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">The act of throwing 
        isolates the thrower. Alone at the bar, without his colleagues in the 
        military community, John Wayne explains his hatred of doctors to Constance 
        Towers. At the end of his long monologue, he throws his bottle at the 
        glasses on the bar. This behaviour from a Northern officer in <i>The Horse 
        Soldiers</i> is ambiguous, even contradictory: each time he is successful 
        in a military operation, he throws objects in anger, as if he had failed 
        in his duty. Obliged to command his regiment to fire on the Southerners 
        despite his abhorrence at starting battles, he traces with his right arm 
        the gesture of throwing his hat on the ground in despair. When his regiment 
        reaches the point of overpowering the Southern front, Wayne arrives on 
        his horse at the height of fighting. To express his disgust at the useless 
        gunfire, he throws the scarf from around his neck into the distance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">We should not pretend 
        that these gestures of Wayne’s illustrate Ford’s anti-militarism or supposed 
        pacifism. What is essential is that the throwing theme isolates the Wayne 
        character at the heart of his profession and shows his solitude. On the 
        narrative plane, how the act of throwing creates an event is by showing 
        the colonel’s neck deprived of the scarf that has been thrown far away, 
        and which is then replaced by the silk scarf from Towers’ hair. During 
        his last mission, where he destroys a bridge in order to escape a bloody 
        battle, he ties this scarf around his neck. In <i>Fort Apache</i>, this 
        time without any erotic context, Wayne will again thrown his scarf to 
        the ground, when he realises that his regiment, under Henry Fonda’s command, 
        is trapped in a hopeless battle that they could have fled. This throwing 
        gesture which expresses renunciation echoes that of Chief Cochise who 
        picks things up from the ground in order to once more throw them down.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><i>The Throwing Woman</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">It has often been said 
        that Ford’s films illustrate or defend the values of male communities. 
        The throwing theme, every time, indicates the contrary. Without exception, 
        apart from the rare collective hurls, this theme isolates the hero at 
        the heart of a group. It is rather the women who achieve solidarity with 
        these heroes, bu throwing objects with an aplomb equal to the men.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">From her first appearance 
        in <i>My Darling Clementine</i>, Chihuahua (Linda Darnell), waitress in 
        the Tombstone bar, circulates among the card players that include Wyatt 
        Earp (Henry Fonda). Having caught a chip in mid-air – with a deftness 
        identical to that of the singer on Dennis O’Dea street gathering up the 
        money that has been thrown away in <i>The Informer</i> – she manipulates 
        this chip as she sings, and gives a sign to the boss concerning the card 
        players. She then throws the chip on the table. The singer’s attitude 
        can be compared to that of the Fordian heroes who throw an object in order 
        to conclude a scene. Realising her role as a spy, Fonda brusquely grabs 
        Chihuahua and throws her into a large tub of water. Note that this scene 
        reproduces that of the card game in Allan Dwan’s <i>Frontier Marshall</i> 
        (1939), which Ford remade. In the Dwan, Earp (Randolph Scott) throws the 
        spying waitress (Binnie Barnes) – but she herself had thrown nothing. 
        Darnell’s behaviour is thus purely an invention of Ford’s.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Jean Arthur in <i>The 
        Whole Town’s Talking</i> (1935) throws her hat and cardboard cup with 
        a lightness that is similar to John Wayne’s in <i>The Quiet Man</i>. Darnell 
        in <i>My Darling Clementine</i> throws her beer glass onto the bar just 
        like Wayne in <i>The Horse Soldiers</i>. Ava Gardner in <i>Mogambo</i> 
        (1953), alone in her room, unsuccessful in her attempt to seduce Clark 
        Gable, angrily hurls a suitcase and a wine bottle as forcefully as she 
        can. As for Maureen O’Hara in <i>The Wings of Eagles</i>, she throws her 
        hat and towel as nonchalantly as Wayne wields a flower bouquet. Elizabeth 
        Allen in <i>Donovan’s Reef</i>, led by Wayne into his father’s house, 
        throws off her handbag, high heels and hat with an entirely masculine 
        ardour. And finally, Vera Miles in <i>Rookie of the Year</i> throws her 
        gun in a way that recalls Ben Johnson’s gesture in <i>Wagon Master</i>. 
        In short: the throwing theme applies equally well to women as to men.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2">3. It is surprising 
        to read in a monograph: ‘The film ends, as all good Westerns do, with 
        the hero riding off away from the camera towards the distant horizon - 
        but not alone like Shane. The Western hero as inveterate loner is an invention 
        of the post-war period, when the Western's age of innocence was over and 
        the hero had existential burdens to bear.’ Edward Buscombe, <i>Stagecoach</i> 
        (British Film Institute, 1992), p. 76. Two brief remarks: at the end of 
        <i>Stagecoach</i>, Wayne has no intention of riding off towards the horizon. 
        Accompanied by the Sherrif (George Bancroft), he agrees to go to prison. 
        Then it comes as a surprise that he leaves with Claire Trevor, under the 
        hail of stones thrown by the Sheriff and the Doctor (Thomas Mitchell). 
        In regards to the ‘loner’, contrary to what Buscombe says, Western heroes 
        were already solitary in the silent era, not only in William S. Hart’s 
        films but also those Ford made with Harry Carey, such as <i>Straight Shooting</i> 
        (1917).</font> </p>

        Benign/Malign</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Throwing the same object 
        can express different emotions according to the narrative situation. For 
        instance, characters throw rocks to several different ends. We remember 
        Wayne, chased by Indians in <i>Stagecoach</i>, at a crucial moment in 
        the hasty crossing of the river throwing rocks at the horses to make them 
        move. Victor Mature in flight in <i>My Darling Clementine</i>, sitting 
        next to the hurrying coach driver, also throws rocks at the horses to 
        make them go faster. Among Westerns, only Ford’s show men throwing stones 
        at animals so frequently. In <i>Stagecoach</i>, this act of throwing takes 
        on a liberating quality. In the final scene, we see the Sheriff (George 
        Bancroft) and the Doctor (Thomas Mitchell) throw, in jest, stones at the 
        coach holding Wayne and Claire Trevor. This benign gesture of throwing 
        closes the film. (3)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">On the other hand, 
        stones are thrown without prior intention into ponds or rivers. In <i>The 
        Lost Patrol</i>, a soldier in the middle of the desert throws a small 
        stone into the water of an oasis, in despair at being encircled by unseen 
        enemies. In contrast, when Richard Widmark in <i>Two Rode Together</i> 
        (1961), during his exchange with Shirley Jones in the forest, throws a 
        stone in the pond, the surface of the water, rippling with circular waves, 
        prefigures the fulfillment of their love. This scene recalls a particularly 
        beautiful moment in the Fordian œuvre. Henry Fonda in <i>Young Mr Lincoln</i> 
        (1939), about to depart from his beloved, stands at the edge of a river, 
        slowly approaches the water and throws a stone. It is a splendid scene. 
        The water’s surface is covered by growing circles, thematically signifying 
        his farewell to the woman he loves. In the following shot, we understand 
        that she has died. The future President of the United States pays a visit, 
        in the cold of winter, to her snow-covered grave. The throwing theme has 
        engendered a sober transitional scene announcing the annihilation of this 
        female presence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">A stone thrown into 
        water can also provoke an apparition. In <i>The Searchers</i>, Wayne hunts 
        for his niece who has been snatched by Indians. After several years, he 
        finds but cannot save her, since she behaves like an indigenous person, 
        and has become part of the Chief’s family. Wayne and his nephew (Jeffrey 
        Hunter) thus find themselves in the middle of the desert, completely devastated. 
        Unconsciously, Wayne picks up a stone and throws it into a pond. As if 
        in response to his gesture, a tiny, female silhouette appears, climbing 
        down the hill like normal. It is a magic moment, for this apparition of 
        Wayne’s niece confirms, unexpectedly, the constancy of the throwing theme. 
        But it is also a tragic moment, since this theme recalls the death of 
        a beloved. Whence Wayne’s violence, which can countenance neither the 
        appearance of his niece nor the disappearance of his sister-in-law. Was 
        Ford, while shooting <i>The Searchers</i>, dreaming of that farewell scene 
        at the river’s edge in <i>Young Mr Lincoln</i>? At an interval of seventeen 
        years, these two films answer the question via the gestures of Wayne and 
        Fonda throwing a stone into water. The Fordian œuvre comes into its own 
        through this knitting-up of the interfilmic thematic game of throwing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><i><br>
        Solitude</i></font><b> </b></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Only those characters 
        capable of throwing an object at decisive moments are truly Fordian. They 
        are defined neither by their character nor their profession, but by their 
        performance of the act of throwing. However, this visible system is rarely 
        perceived as the manifestation of a theme. The way in which Wayne throws 
        off his scarf in <i>Fort Apache</i> is too fleeting, visually, to be noticed. 
        The filmmaker reprises this scarf theme in <i>The Horse Soldiers</i> in 
        order to insist on the character’s solitude. It is in this light that 
        the films of Ford’s final decade must be regarded.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">When Ford declared 
        to Peter Bogdanovich that <i>The Searchers</i> was the ‘tragedy of a loner,’ 
        Lindsay Anderson was scandalised by this choice of word. (4) Surely Ford 
        was wrong about his own film, mistaking Wayne’s ‘neurotic’ personality 
        for that of a loner? After all, he secretly loves his sister-in-law, something 
        that Ford claimed critics did not notice! (5) Was this British critic, 
        theatre director and filmmaker – for whom Ford’s career peaked at <i>The 
        Sun Shines Bright</i> (1953) – sensitive to the magic of Wayne throwing 
        a stone in water, thus evoking the memory of a dead woman? Did he understand 
        that, in every Ford film, this solitary gesture uncovers a thematic configuration 
        based on the act of throwing? Precisely because of their solitude, Fordian 
        characters are in solidarity via the emotion that is expressed by throwing 
        an object far into the distance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">In Ford – unlike in 
        Howard Hawks – it is rare that, as a sign of friendship or partnernship, 
        people share an object by throwing it. In contrast to the matchbox thrown 
        by Humphrey Bogart to Lauren Bacall in <i>To Have and Have Not</i> (1944), 
        or the gun thrown by Ricky Nelson to John Ford in <i>Rio Bravo</i> (1959) 
        – optimistic images of solidarity – the rifle exchanged between Woody 
        Strode and Wayne in <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i> expresses 
        the ‘tragedy of a loner’. Vera Miles, the beloved woman, belongs to another 
        man, as in <i>The Searchers</i>. We have seen it: Wayne parts from her 
        by tossing an extinguised match as a sign of farewell. In the following 
        scene, at a saloon bar, he throws his cigarette on the floor. He knocks 
        out one of Liberty’s henchmen, throws his gun on the bar and hurls his 
        whiskey glass at those who are escaping. Drunk, he throws the payment 
        for his libation at the barman and leaves the saloon, bottle in hand. 
        At the doorway, he throws still more money at the band. Wayne the actor 
        seems to parody himself, repeating the gestures he made in <i>The Horse 
        Soldiers</i>. The narrative effect of the throwing theme is very emphatic 
        here. Before entering his home, he throws the bottle into the garden and, 
        once inside, lights a lamp and throws it against the wall.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">This self-destruction 
        on Wayne’s part, via successive acts of throwing, perfectly illustrates 
        the solitude of the Fordian hero. The thrown lamp, however, does not conclude 
        this particular film. Does the throwing theme bring about the narrative 
        tying-together of <i>Liberty Valance</i>? It is usually said that the 
        film ends with the image of a departing train, carrying the Senator and 
        his wife. But there is another Fordian gesture that concludes the narrative. 
        James Stewart goes to light his pipe. Seeing the joy of the controller 
        who hails him as the man who shot Liberty Valance, he blows out his match 
        and begins to throw it away. Nothing is more specific to Ford than this 
        suspended gesture of a character, an extinguished match in his hand. The 
        Senator seems to want to claim the dignity of being Fordian! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">But it easy to grasp 
        how <i>Seven Women</i> (1965), with Anne Bancroft as a doctor who sacrifices 
        herself to a Mongolian bandit in order to save her companions, is profoundly 
        Fordian. The throwing theme illustrates, to the highest degree, the central 
        character’s solitude. Recall her final gesture: downing a poisoned wine 
        glass, which she then throws to the ground with a resigned smile. A fade-out 
        slowly effaces her image from the screen, as the words ‘The End’ appear 
        on the black screen. This disappearance, echoing the signs of farewell 
        characteristic of the Fordian thematic of throwing, marks not only the 
        end of this film, but the entire Fordian œuvre. No other filmmaker has 
        ended his career with such mastery. </font></p>
