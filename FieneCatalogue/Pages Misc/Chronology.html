Close relationships develop with artists Jules Pascin and Robert Laurent, with whom he had socialized in New York. For a while Pascin lends him his studio on the Boulevard Clichy, but it is the work of Matisse that makes the greatest impression on the artist, especially in the figure studies he executes in Pacin's studio.</p>

					<p><b>1959-1964</b>: Teaches at the National Academy School of Fine Art, New York City.</p>
					<p><b>1959</b>: Exhibits, for the last time during his lifetime, a series of New York City works at the Midtown Galleries in Manhattan (Jan. 27-Feb. 21). Critics of the exhibition see the newer cityscapes as more abstract and more precisionist than those of his earlier periods. Carlyle Burrows of the New York Herald Tribune compares his new work to that of Charles Sheeler.  Noted in catalogue as most recent show since one man show at Knoedler's in 1949.</p>
					<p><b>1960</b>: Travels through Europe during July and August, first on a tour, probably for Famous Artists School, then on his own in southern Italy, where he meets other artists in Positano. Expects Alicia to join him in Madrid in mid-August. Correspondence reveals Alicia's illness affecting travel plans. Unclear if she actually manages to make trip.</p>

					<p><b>1965</b>: Travels to Paris to execute a series of color lithographs in the atelier of Edmond Desjobert (who himself had died two years earlier), the same print shop where he had made black ink lithographs in 1929. Dies of a heart attack in Paris on August 10, while making prints, in the company of his long-time artist friends Adolf Dehn and Federico Castellon at Desjobert's.</p>
					<p>Adolf Dehn's wife, Virginia Dehn, in a letter to Ernest Fiene's son Paul about the death of his father wrote the following:</p>
					<dl>
						<dd>We loved your father, too. He was a wonderfully warm and human man. Even though it is terrible and difficult for you there to have this happen so far away please know that he was happy and excited about his work here. We are glad that he came to Paris because he was doing some fine lithographs and that, as you know, is the best morale booster for an artist <font size="2">(unpublished letter, August 10, 1965, Fiene family personal files)</font>.
