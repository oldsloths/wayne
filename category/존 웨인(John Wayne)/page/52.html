+ span style="옵션:설정값;옵션:설정값....;"
font-family: 으뜸 글꼴과 버금글꼴은 쉼표로 구분한다. 예를 들어 span style="font-family:serif,sans-serif;"
font-size : 글꼴 크기. 단위는 pt, m, cm, in, px, em(기본 글꼴 높이에 대한 상대적인 높이), ex(기본 글꼴의 알파벳 소문자 x의 높이에 대한 상대적인 높이)
font-style : normal, italic
text-decoration : underline,overline, line-through, blink
font-weight : 글꼴 두께. normal, bold, bolder, lighter, 100~900
color : 글꼴 색상.
background-color : 문단 배경색. 넷스케이프의 경우는 글자가 있는 곳까지만 적용되므로, 상자모양으로 배경색을 넣고 싶으면  margin:0; padding:10; border-width:1; border-style:none; 와 같은 스타일 옵션도 적어주어야 한다.
background-image : 문단 배경 그림 넣기
background-repeat : 문단 배경 그림의 반복 형식. 기본값은 repeat이며, 그 외 no-repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y
text-align : left, center, right, justify(양쪽정렬)
vertical-align: top, middle, bottom 
text-indent : 문단의 첫줄 들여쓰기. 단위는 %, pt, mm, cm, in, px 등등.
line-height : 문단의 줄 간격. 단위는 %, pt, mm, cm, in, px 등등. 아무 단위도 쓰지 않은 경우는 기본 줄간격의 배수로 설정된다. 단, 100 이상을 입력하면 자동으로 %단위로 설정된다.
letter-spacing : 글자 간격. 넷스케이프에는 적용 안됨. 단위는 절대길이 단위만 써야 함.
margin : 문단 여백 설정하기. 각 방향의 여백을 따로 지정하려면 margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom. default 단위는 px.
padding : 문단 안쪽 여백 설정하기. 각 방향의 여백을 따로 지정하려면 padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, padding-bottom. default 단위는 px.
border-style : 문단 테두리의 모양새. solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset.
border-color : 문단 테두리의 색깔. 각 방향 별로 다르게 할 수도 있기는 하다. border-left-color...
border-width : 문단 테두리의 폭. 기본 단위는 px.  border-left-width....

+ 선택적인 줄 나누기
그림을 왼쪽, 오른쪽으로 정렬했을 경우, 그림 옆으로 여러줄의 문장을 배치할 수 있는데, 그림 옆에 배치되어 있는 문단의 중간을 잘라서 그림 아래쪽에 이어서 표시하고자 할때, 적당한 수의 빈 줄을 넣어서 할 수도 있지만, 이 경우 나중에 새로운 문단이 추가된다거나 하면 엉망이 되므로, br 태그의 clear 속성을 이용한다.
br clear="left" 왼쪽 여백이 없는 곳까지.(그림 정렬 = left 일 때)
br clear="right" 오른쪽 여백이 없는 곳까지.(그림 정렬 = right 일 때)
br clear="all" 양쪽 여백이 없는 곳까지.(그림 정렬 방식에 관계없이 그림이 없는 곳까지 줄을 나눈다)

He ended up exiled, alone, to wander between the winds. Our last shot of him shows the door of civilisation slamming shut, with him still on the outside. </p><p>That was, of course, John Wayne in John Ford's great The Searchers of 1956, and how long ago it seems. There's no-one now who can stand next to him, but few would want to. Wayne was, in words not invented for him by DH Lawrence but so appropriate, "hard, isolate, stoic and a killer". </p><div id="inline250" style="DISPLAY: inline; FLOAT: right; MARGIN: 3px 0px 0px 8px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom"></div><p>That sort of tendency toward destruction has all but left the screen now, though it had a long run. As late at the 1970s, Clint Eastwood could build a major career out of a stoic, lonely killer named Dirty Harry and become iconic for his willingness to shoot to kill. He had something else as well, and it's the missing ingredient from today's movies - he knew it was all right to be hated. Hollywood historian David Thomson once called Wayne "the crown prince of difficult men". The stars of his generation knew that the price of heroism, of domination, of certitude, of command, was loneliness - or possibly, since they were so disconnected from their emotions they'd never acknowledge such a thing - aloneness. </p><p>Look at Gregory Peck in, say, Twelve O'Clock High or Clark Gable in Command Decision, two movies of leadership agonistes set against the strategic bombing missions of the Second World War. In both cases - you could add dozens more - they were men who made decisions that cost other men their lives; they were hated, even loathed; they lived and drank alone. Their courage wasn't physical, it was almost metaphysical. They had the strength within themselves to ignore (though not really; underneath it hurt) the will of the consensus and pleadings for such shady attributes as "compassion" and "humanity." They knew the job came first. </p><p>That certitude has vanished from many places, but nowhere more vividly than the top of the male star pile in Hollywood. Mel Gibson, who played an action hero, seems to have morphed into director, producer and madman, melting down in a pool of seething angers and resentments. Then there's Tom Cruise, recently dumped by Paramount for (1) personal oddnesses and (2) delivering a movie that may only make $400 million worldwide when everyone knew it should have made $500 million. Down but not out, each actor, you can bet, will hasten to a film highlighting redemption, earnestness, decency and love of fellow man. Don't bet on either's next movie to co-star a submachine gun. In short, they're no longer going to be John Ford heroes but Frank Capra heroes. </p><p>So who's left? Almost nobody. Eastwood is too old, Arnold is too gubernatorial. Harrison Ford is ancient, Sylvester Stallone too kitschy as well as too old. Let's look at a younger generation: Matt Damon? Only joking. Ben Affleck? Too pretty, really. Leonardo DiCaprio? Again, I joke. Mark Wahlberg? Hmmm, we'll have to wait and see. Where have all the action heroes gone? They certainly haven't gone to be soldiers; no, they've gone to be sensitive, not so much in the touchy-feely way, but in that way that strikes at their essence. They no longer dominate. </p><p>That's really what the action hero had in spades, and, according to the script, it made other men fear, respect and obey him; and it made women fear, respect and obey him. (You'll note that love had nothing to do with it.) In one sense, he was abusive. Look at The Searchers through a lens of modern revisionism and you see quite a bit of ugliness in Wayne's great Ethan Edwards. He was racist, he was a bully, a tyrant, the father a son could never impress. Quick to anger, slow to forgive, given to spasms of violence. Perhaps Ford's last best message to us was the ferocity by which, through Edwards, he de-idealised the hero. It was as if, like Wayne, he sailed into a mellower old age parodying and sweetening the rage that had made him so great, yet so distant, but not before he told us: These men were great. And they were necessary. And they were heroic. But they were also mean, cruel and masterful and dominating, and if you got on their wrong side, they made you pay. </p><p>Today's stars need love. They don't want to be feared, they want to be hugged. They don't want to shoot anyone, if possible; they certainly won't beat a confession out of a suspect or verbally rip the head off a kid who's new to the unit and trying hard. Their anger is well managed. They never get even, they don't punish, they see the folly of vengeance, they inflict pain only on special occasions. (Last year's Sin City was one such occasion, where the point of the film was its removal from a moral spectrum, thus allowing its brutish heroes the freedom to torture, as each did.) </p><p>Only a few boys seem to have the man-junk that can get them through the heavy lifting of a hero's role. Chief among these is Samuel L Jackson. He's in the one with the snakes. In fact, he is the one with the snakes, for without his anchoring presence in the lighter-than-air Snakes on a Plane, the whole thing blows away like a broken kite. </p><p>In the film, Jackson seems to have beamed in from the 1950s. I think the Duke would approve. Jackson is discovered with a gun in his hand; it's never far from him throughout. He doesn't talk, he growls. "If you want to live, stay by me." See, it's just not guns. It's also a kind of certitude, a kind of sublime, inbred sense of knowing what to do next. </p><p>Denzel Washington is almost always given nice rational roles where his handsomeness, debonair manner and brilliant dentition can dominate - but when called upon, he can unleash a serious junkyard dog of rage. In the long-forgotten The Siege, he played an FBI team leader with exactly the right mix of Harvard Business School management smarts and some alley-style true grit, again of a sort that would have made John Wayne all to bust with pride. Another man with that talent and presence: George Clooney. He's got a film noir coming out called The Good German, in which he's investigating clandestine activities in postwar Germany, under the assured direction of Steven Soderbergh. In black-and-white, no less! Clooney has the presence and the strength it takes to play a man who doesn't mind being hated. His best performance came in David O Russell's Three Kings, where he played a disgruntled Green Beret officer in the first Gulf War who finds a shot at a fortune, presses it hard and ruthlessly, but then encounters that terror known as duty, and performs heroically. That's the kind of weight up top that's missing from so many movies these days. </p><p>Let's try to construct the perfect action hero by combining the best of old and new. We don't want too much subtext, because nobody wants a leader with issues. You just want pure grit, true-blue dedication, toughness but fairness, and you want him to convey the idea that he'll be the first man up the hill and the last man off it. Let's give him John Wayne's eyes. His weren't big, booming, expressive eyes, like some of our more womanly movie boys today, but narrow - hooded, you would say, wary. They'd seen too much; they were quick to register anomalies or vibrations of discontent. They were also wise eyes - they could crackle with fire and beam ever so briefly with love. </p><p>Let's give him Clint Eastwood's dim little jot of a mouth. He didn't have a booming voice, probably his biggest flaw as an actor (he had to pretend to be all gravelly when he talked, else we'd notice how banal he was when he spoke), but his mouth was just a pucker of distaste. It was the prime signifier of his disdain for what was going on. That stoical, grim, quiet mouth made two pronouncements: I am death, and do not mess with me. It was advice well heeded. </p><p>For voice, let's go with Samuel L Jackson. What an instrument: He can make you laugh or cry with it, feel his indignation or pain, or just plain scare the living bejeepers out of you. Intensity would have to be Mr Cruise's contribution. Though far from a great actor, Cruise has the movie star ability to manifest one overwhelming attribute. In his case, it's a blazing intensity; his eyes become laser beams, his muscles tighten, his mouth becomes a vice clamped into absolute rectitude. Somehow, if you feel nothing else, you feel his total will. </p><p>Jaw? This one has to come from Randolph Scott. Anyone remember him, beside you Cary Grant fans? Well, Randolph Scott had the squarest jaw on the planet. It was carved from pure granite. </p><p>From whom do we take cool? Oh, this is a tough one. Lee Marvin was ultra-cool. Ever see him in Point Blank? What about The Dirty Dozen? With his untroubled demeanour and the sudden economy of action, nobody was cooler than Lee Marvin. Except, maybe, Steve McQueen. Now he was cool. Icy blue eyes, blond hair, but blond in a scruffy OK way, not a beach boy coif. He had a jazz-riff, white hipster's vibration going on that you can see a little of in Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, but nobody has ever been as cool as McQueen in Bullitt or The Great Escape. </p><p>Finally: grace. The movies love it. A man has to move with confidence and sleekness when he walks, to be an action hero. He has to do everything with style and force and yet there can be nothing forced about it. You might think I'd go for John Wayne, because nobody expressed more than John Wayne in the simple act of moving from here to there. But there was this other man who moved like a leopard, had power to spare but a smoothness and precision in his body as if he'd been an acrobat. He blew everybody off the screen when he moved, and even when he didn't move and wore a suit - I'm thinking of the great Sweet Smell of Success - the poetry of his containment expressed enormous power. The camera loved him and a new generation would discover him. And guess what, he was an ex-acrobat - Burt Lancaster.</p><p class="print">&nbsp;</p>
