        <p><font size="2"> <img src="posters/quietman.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="532" /> <img src="reddot.gif" /> <b>The
              Quiet Man</b> (1952) is director John Ford's epic romantic comedy
              - a loving, sentimental, nostalgic tribute to his Irish ancestry
              and homeland. A rich, beautifully-textured Technicolor presentation
              deserving of its Color Cinematography award, it was filmed mostly
              on location in Ireland, although some backdrops and background
              studio shots were obviously intermixed. Its screenplay was based
              on Frank Nugent's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's <i>Saturday Evening
              Post</i> 1933 short story <i>Green Rushes</i>. Ford considered
              the rollicking, comedy love story one of his favorite films.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">  The memorable plot was about the collision course
            between an anti-materialistic, Irish-American boxer nicknamed 'Trooper
            Thornton' (Wayne) in the town of Innisfree in the land of his Irish
            birthplace and a local, mean bully (McLaglen). They became  further
            entangled when he fell in love with the man's fiesty, red-haired,
            materialistic sister (O'Hara) who refused to consummate her marriage
            without her dowry (350 Irish pounds in gold). The story was inspired
            by a Celtic myth about a monumental battle between two sacred kings
            (gods) who annually fought for the affections of a queen (or goddess).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">The famous director of westerns had already won Best
            Director Academy Award Oscars for three previous <i>non</i>-Western
            films - <i>The Informer (1935)</i>, <a href="grap.html"><i>The Grapes
            of Wrath (1940)</i></a>, and <a href="howg.html"><i>How Green Was
            My Valley (1941)</i></a>. This sentimental film, Ford's first 'romantic
            love story,' received a total of seven Academy Awards nominations
            (including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor - Victor McLaglen,
            Best Screenplay - Frank Nugent, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound)
            and won two Oscars: Best Cinematography - Winton Hoch and Archie
            Stout, and Ford (at 57 years of age) won his fourth and final Best
            Director Oscar, establishing a record that is still unbeaten.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">In the seventeen years of Republic's existence, it
        was the first film for the studio that was nominated for Best Picture.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Because the film was an ambitious, personal pet project
            and not one of Ford's typical westerns, he was unable to find financial
            backing from the major Hollywood studios, so he turned to Republic
            Pictures, a smaller studio regarded as <i>the</i> studio for B-pictures
            and low-budget westerns. After the financial and critical success
            of <i>Rio Grande (1950)</i> for the studio, the third of Ford's 'cavalry
            trilogy,' he convinced Republic Pictures to support him for his next
            riskier film - an Irish &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; tale that
            was remarkably similar in plot. He brought the same stock company
            of actors from his western - John Wayne, Victor McLaglen, and Maureen
            O'Hara - to Ireland to film his humorous, epic romance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">It has been said that John Wayne represented John Ford
            on-screen as a younger 'alter-ego' of the famous American film director.
            [Note: Ford was born Sean Aloysius Feeney/O'Fearna in 1895 in Maine,
            the youngest son of an Irish immigrant who had 13 children.] It is
            probably not just coincidence that Maureen O'Hara's character name
            is Mary (Ford's wife's name) Kate (the name of his unrealized love
            - Katharine Hepburn). Ford also cast his brother Francis (a silent
            film actor and director) in a cameo role as patriarch Dan Tobin -
            an ailing, white-bearded elderly man who refuses to die before witnessing
            the donnybrook fist fight in the finale.</font></p>
        <font color="#666666" size="4"><strong>The Story</strong></font>
        <hr align="left" width="95%" size="1" />
        <p><font size="2">The idyllic, romanticized film opens, after a credits
            sequence with warm, sun-drenched tones and music, with the central
            character, an Irish-American, arriving by steam locomotive at the
            train station in the Irish hamlet of Castletown. The action is narrated,
            in flashback, by an offscreen character, the local Catholic Father
            Peter Lonergan (Ward Bond), the priest of the parish who is also
            a devoted fisherman, as he clears his throat:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Now, I'll begin at the beginnin'. A fine soft day
              [Irish for 'it's raining or misting'] in the spring it was when
              the train pulled into Castletown three hours late as usual, and
              himself got off. He didn't have the look of an American tourist
              at all about him. Not a camera on him. And what was worse, not
              even a fishing rod.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">As he steps from the dark green train, Sean Thornton
            (John Wayne) inquires about the whereabouts of the quaint, simple
            town of Innisfree [a name symbolically representing freedom and a
            return to an innocent past] from an assortment of loveable Irish
            characters - the train conductor, engineer and other stereotypical
            townsfolk. He is led from the train into an ancestral past - to an
            open, single horse drawn carriage by a spritely, derby-hatted, pipe-smoking,
            elfin Michaeleen Oge Flynn (Barry Fitzgerald), the local taxi-cab
            driver, book-maker, and match-maker. [The suffix <i>'een'</i> denotes
            little and is often used affectionately.]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">They ride under a train bridge after the train pulls
            out of the station - the 20th century vehicle passes over them as
            they enter the lush green countryside of Sean's past life. Michaeleen
            learns that the 'six-foot four and a half' American is from &quot;Pittsburgh.&quot; At
            a little stone bridge crossing a stream, Sean pauses, looks toward
            a small thatched cottage in the distance, and listens in his mind
            to his deceased mother's gentle voice reminiscing to him as a child
            about her memories of her past life in the village - the location
            of his birth and youth where she grew roses:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Don't you <i>remember</i> Seannie and how it was?
              The road led up past the chapel and it wound and it wound. And
              there was the field where Dan Tobin's bullock chased you. It was
              a lovely little house, Seaneen. And the roses! Well, your father
              used to tease me about them. But he was that proud of them too.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">The coachman quips: &quot;That's nothin' but a wee,
            humble cottage.&quot; Sean asks about the owner of the small cottage: &quot;That
            little place across the brook, that humble cottage - who owns it
            now?&quot; After being told that the widow Mrs. Sarah Tillane (Mildred
            Natwick) owns but doesn't live in the cottage, he firmly intends
            to remain in the foreign land - his new 'home' and place of refuge
            - and purchase the &quot;wee humble cottage&quot; of his birth, forsaking
            the harsh blast furnaces of his American industrial homeland (with &quot;steel
            and pig iron furnaces so hot a man forgets his fear of hell&quot;).
            Michaeleen is one of the few Irish townsfolk who knew Sean in his
            childhood:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Sean: Do you think she'd sell it?<br />
            Michaeleen: I doubt it.<br />
            Sean: Don't bet on it, 'cause I'm buyin' it.<br />
            Michaeleen: Now why would a, why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh want
            to buy it?<br />
            Sean: I'll tell you why Michaeleen Oge Flynn, young small Michael
            Flynn who used to wipe my runny nose when I was a kid. Because I'm
            Sean Thornton and I was born in that little cottage over there. And
            I've come home, and home I'm gonna stay. Now does that answer your
            questions once and for all, you nosy little man?<br />
            Michaeleen: Seanin Thornton! And look at you now...What do they feed
            you, all you men who are in Pittsburgh?<br />
            Sean: Steel...Steel and pig iron furnaces so hot a man forgets his
            fear of hell. When you're hard enough, tough enough, other things,
            other things Michaeleen.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Father Lonergan, who is afoot on the winding road and
            meets them, narrates: 
          &quot;Now then, here comes myself. That's me there, walking, that tall
          saintly looking man. Peter Lonergan, parish priest.&quot; It is a homecoming
          for Sean who is &quot;home from America&quot; where his widowed, hard-working,
          immigrant mother died in America when he was only twelve. Father Lonergan
          remembers Sean's Irish ancestors (his parents and grandparents), and
          then invites him to the next morning's Catholic mass:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Father Lonergan: Ah yes, I knew your people, Sean.
              Your grandfather - he died in Australia in a penal colony. And
              your father, he was a good man too. Bad accident that. And your

            Sean: She's dead. America, when I was twelve.<br />
            Father Lonergan: (piously) I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow,
            Sean. (sternly) You'll be there, seven o'clock.<br />
            Sean: Sure I will.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2">In one of the film's most fanciful, breathtaking, painterly
            scenes of the picturesque, pastoral Irish countryside (and the entrance
            scene for the film's star actress), Sean walks to an emerald-green
            grassy area of foliage where black-faced sheep are herded by a collie.
            As he lights a cigarette within a grove of tall trees, he turns and
            has a transcendent, romanticized vision of a red-haired, blue-bloused,
            scarlet-skirted, bare-footed lass (Maureen O'Hara as Mary Kate Danaher)
            tending the flock of sheep in the meadow. In the scene common in
            storybooks and legends of the past, Sean is transfixed by the ravishingly
            beautiful, auburn-haired Irish woman in the lush, emerald surroundings
            - she is equally interested in him and gives him a lengthy glance.
            Although her presence becomes a second reason to make Ireland his
            new home, the American is so awed and dazzled by her beauty that
            he doesn't trust the fairy-tale he has seen:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Sean: (rhetorically to Michaeleen about his distorted
              perceptions) Hey, is that real? She couldn't be.<br />
            Michaeleen: Oh nonsense, man. It's only a mirage brought on by your
            terrible thirst.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">To put an end to the imagined mirage, Michaeleen drives
            them to Innisfree's local pub/bar, run by publican Pat Cohan.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Early the next morning, Sean kneels in the Catholic
            church. A floor-level camera angle frames the colorful stained-glass
            windows at the end of the nave and above the altar. Sean exits down
            the nave toward the camera, passing the sheepherder lass kneeling
            in another pew - she looks after him. [Later, Sean tells her that
            her face was &quot;like a saint.&quot;] Following the Catholic mass,
            Sean waits outside at the back of the stone chapel where the red-haired
            woman follows. No longer in doubt about her, he removes his hat,
            abruptly scoops up ecclesiastical holy water in his palm, and greets
            her: &quot;Good morning.&quot; 
          Without a word, she dips her fingers in the water in his hand, makes
          the sign of the cross with the water, and hurries off - it is a formal,
          spiritual encounter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Down the path, she turns back for two wary but interested
            glances, and remains half-hidden behind a gate as Thornton is scolded
            for his impropriety. Contrary to what Sean thinks of his fantasy
            female goddess, the impish, leprechaun-like matchmaker divulges her
            name, her eligibility as a shrew, her hot-headed temper, and the
            lack of a dowry ('fortune'):</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Michaeleen: None of that now, none of that. It's
              a bold sinful man you are, Sean Thornton. And who taught ya to
              be playing patty fingers in the Holy Water?<br />
            Sean: Just bein' polite, that's all.<br />
            Michaeleen: Maybe you don't know it's a privilege for courtin' couples
            and then only when the banns has been read. And Mary Kate Danaher
            dippin' her fingers in as neat as you please.<br />
            Sean: What did you say her name was?<br />
            Michaeleen: Mary Kate Danaher. Now don't be gettin' any notions in
            your head...Forget it, Sean, forget it. Put it out of your mind entirely.<br />
            Sean: Why, what's the matter? She isn't married or anything, is she?<br />
            Michaeleen:...No...and her with her freckles and her temper. Oh that
            red head of hers is no lie. Still, a man might put up with that,
            but not with her lack of a fortune.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">&quot;The wealthiest woman in Innisfree was the Widow
            Tillane. She had neither chick nor child poor soul, but she was well-respected
            and good to the poor.&quot; 
          Escorted by Michaeleen to the widow, Sean negotiates to purchase his
          mother's cottage to recapture his own childhood - his own birthplace: &quot;All
          the Thorntons were born there. Seven generations of them.&quot; The
          widow chides him for wanting to turn the thatched cottage, termed White
          O' Mornin', into &quot;a national shrine, perhaps charge tuppence a
          visit for a guided tour through the little thatched cottage where all
          the Thorntons were born. Are you a man of such eminence then?&quot; Pittsburgh-raised
          in a steel town, Sean assures her that his idealized intentions are
          pure - Innisfree has been his equivalent of &quot;heaven,&quot; his
          Shangri-La salvation from the &quot;hell&quot; of Pittsburgh, his paradise,
          his idealized vision of his mother's memories:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Look, Mrs. Tillane. I'm not talkin' about memorials
              or monuments. It's just that ever since I was a kid livin' in the
              shack near the slag heaps, my mother's told me about Innisfree
              and White O'Mornin'. Innisfree has become another word for heaven
              to me. When I quit the...when I decided to come here, it was with
              one thought in mind.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">The bullying, boorish, Squire Red Will Danaher (Victor
            McLaglen) is immediately brought at odds against Sean Thornton -
            both Danaher and Thornton bid against each other for the widow's
            property. [Smitten by the wealthy widow, Danaher had wished for many
            years to purchase her adjoining property and become her neighbor.]
            Because Danaher had gossiped in the pub and confidently insisted
            that she would marry him, the widow spitefully decided instead to
            sell the adjacent property to the newcomer - thereby alienating Danaher
            and Thornton from the start:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Danaher: Is it true...that behind me back the White
              O'Mornin' right from under me nose?<br />
            Tillane: And what concern of yours is this, Will Danaher?<br />
            Danaher: Concern? Concern enough. Haven't I made you a good fair
            offer for that same piece of land? And mine, lying right next to
            yours.<br />
            Tillane: You may keep your offers. <br />
            Danaher: Oh, so it's true. You've sold it.<br />
            Tillane: No, I have not.<br />
            Danaher: (after a boisterous laugh) I knew it was a dirty lie the
            very minute I heard it. Sure. I said to him, 'Paggy McFarland, you'll
            never make me believe that Sarah Tillane will be selling White O'Mornin'.
            Why, it would be like building a fence between your end and mine
            for a stranger to move in,' says I. 'And what would she be doin'
            that for? And us so close to an understanding,' you might say.<br />
            Tillane: So you told him all that, did you?<br />
            Danaher: That I did. <br />
            Tillane: Down at the pub, I suppose, in front of all those big ears
            with pints in their fists and pipes in their mouths. You may have
            the land, Mr. Thornton, for six hundred pounds.<br />
            Michaeleen: Done!...</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Outbid, the dismayed and angered Danaher vows that
            Thornton will be his enemy: &quot;I've got you down in my book.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2">Barging into the Danaher household after being outsmarted
            in the sale of White O'Mornin', Will bosses his workers to return
            to their work, and then reaches for a bottle of alcohol. Mary Kate,
            his 'spinster' sister, gleefully thinks he has finally received his
            come-uppance, and stands up to her formidable brother:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Mary Kate: Good for Widow Tillane...After all, he's
              [Sean Thornton] got more right to that land than you have. <br />
            Danaher: He'll regret it till his dying day, if he lives that long.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">In the pub, Sean samples one of the &quot;black beers,&quot; and
            offers to buy a round of drinks for everyone. But his generous offer
            of kinship is met with cold silence and suspicious stares - until
            the 'tall man' is befriended by long white-bearded old-timer Dan
            Tobin (Francis Ford, director John Ford's estranged brother). The
            bartender removes his hat in an awed response to a recitation of
            Thornton's lineage. The patriarch remembers his father Michael and
            grand-father Sean: &quot;Bless his memory. So it's himself you're
            named after. Well now, that being the case, it <i>is</i> a pleasant
            evening and we <i>will</i> have a drink.&quot; He pounds his walking
            stick on the bar, as Dermot Fahy (Ken Curtis) starts playing an Irish
            ballad - &quot;The Wild Colonial Boy&quot; on his accordion for all
            to sing.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Dugan was his
              name.<br />
            He was born and bred in Ireland, in a town called Castlemagne<br />
            He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy<br />
            And dearly did his parents love this wild colonial boy.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"> In another room next to the bar, Michaeleen describes
            the strange Yank with a poor man's bed-roll:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">He's a nice, quiet, peace-lovin' man come home to
              Ireland to forget his troubles...Sure, yes, yes, he's a millionaire,
              you know, like all the Yanks. But he's eccentric. Oh, he is eccentric.
              What till I show ya...His bag to sleep in, a sleeping bag, he calls
              it.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">The song, equating Sean Thornton (or his grandfather
            who 'died in Australia...in a penal colony') with the wild colonial
            boy Jack Dugan, continues:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native
              home.<br />
            And to Australia's sunny shores, he was inclined to roam.<br />
            He robbed a wealthy squireen, all arms he did destroy.<br />
            A terror to Australia was this wild colonial boy.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">The hulking Will Danaher strides into the bar, ironically
            just as the words: 
          &quot;He robbed a wealthy squireen&quot; are being sung. Dan Tobin
          welcomes Thornton into the inner circle of Innisfree citizens: &quot;Sean
          Thornton - the men of Innisfree bid you welcome home.&quot; Landowner
          Danaher remains bitter about losing the widow's property to Thornton
          and begrudges him the right to his own birthplace: &quot;I'm a man
          from Innisfree. And the best man. And I bid no welcome to any man fool
          enough to pay a thousand pounds for a bit of land that isn't worth
          two hundred...What right has he to land that he's never worked?&quot; The
          tyrannical brute also forbids the American intruder from expressing
          any interest in his sister:</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2">Thornton: The point is, it's already done. I own
              the property now, and as long as we're gonna be neighbors...<br />
            Danaher: Neighbors? Oh, neighbors. NEVER! And if I so much as catch
            you putting your wet foot on my property...and oh, another thing,
            you keep away from my sister Mary Kate. She's not for the likes of
            you.<br />
            Thornton: Where I come from, we don't talk about our women folk in
            saloons. You sort of make a habit of it.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font size="2">Their conversation turns ugly in the pub when the cantankerous
            Danaher is called a liar for suspecting that Thornton &quot;took
            liberties that he shouldn't have&quot; at the back of the chapel
            - Sean's &quot;Good Morning&quot; wasn't genuine - according to Danaher: &quot;it
            was Good Night&quot; that he had on his mind. The two are commanded
            by Father Lonergan to shake hands - their extended handshake turns
            into a combative, iron grip as they painfully squeeze each other's
            hands as tightly as possible. They both wince during their first
      physical display of competitive manhood.</font></p></td>
