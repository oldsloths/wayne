<p><strong>Mission with no record - fiction</strong></p>James Warner Bellah<p>  The Officer of the Guard heard the sound of many wagon wheels echoing up from the Sudro Road.  It was almost four in the morning and the dawn wind that carried the sound husked across the Forth Starke parade ground, pelting sand at the pine boards of the Officers' Picket Quarters, lashing the taut halyards in a frenzied tattoo against the flagpole.</p>
<p>  The O.G. started running--those wagons were the replacement detail, almost a day ahead of time.  He skirted the parade ground and took the shortcut past Colonel Massarene's isolated quarters, back toward the guardhouse.  Then he stopped stock-still in his tracks, his head cocked to the soft call of a violin--"Samanthe...while the moon doth shine...Samanthe."  Through the lighted window of the C. O.'s quarters, he could see the slender silhouette of Colonel Massarene, head bent, arm crooked to the bow, drawing out a gentle song of lost years and of forgotten candlelight and of jasmine on the night air--"Samanthe--"</p>
<p>  For a second, the Officer of the Guard stood listening and staring in utter disbelief.  A frigid shadow of a man, D. L. Massarene, living in Capuchin solitude with one chair, one cot, one table.  Ruling the West and the regiment with it, with the iron hand of duty.  Never a meal with another officer.  Never a word of praise or a word for laughter.  Alone there and friendless, with the grisly sobbing of his violin to lift the lost years from his soul and give him surcease.</p>
<p>  Suddenly to the O.G., it was as if he were peeping--as if he had sneaked into another man's privacy and desecrated it, for in some strange fashion there was the honor of a woman in that song . . . and bitter tears and lonely desperation.  In quick embarrassment, he turned and ran again, toward headquarters and the guardhouse and the slow, rocketing sound of the wagon convoy that was rolling onto the post now from the Sudro Road.</p>
<p>  The O.G. came up behind Sergeant Shattuck, and the sergeant swung around.  "Recruit replacement from Jefferson Barracks, Mr. Topliff; 18 hours ahead of schedule.  General Sheridan rode in with 'em from Elkhorn.  He's in post headquarters.  A runner's gone for the colonel."  D'Arcy Topliff took the headquarters veranda in two long strides.  Philip Henry Sheridan, his back to the hanging lamp, was flicking the damper, toeing open the draft, throwing in post oak until the stove roared like a river boat.</p>
<p>  "Sheridan, mister"--in a bleak York State twang--"what about coffee?"</p>
<p>  "Topliff, Officer of the Guard, sir," and D'Arcy put the duty coffeepot on.</p>
<p>  Sheridan stretched out his hands to thaw their numbing chill.  He must have looked pinched and blue this way, the morning he galloped in from Winchester to smash Jubal Early, for it can be cold in the early mornings in October in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>  Colonel Massarene, running along the headquarters duckboards, struck the veranda once, lightly, and pushed open the door with a quick insistence that flowed through him easily from head to clicked heels, to voice, "Good morning, general."</p>
<p>  Sheridan said, "Seven years, isn't it, Massarene, since we last had coffee together?"</p>
<p>  "Seven, sir.  Even.  On the fifteenth of next month."</p>
<p>  Tall, Massarene.  Spare, almost to a whisper of pain, but a magnificent animal turned like a fine tool to his job.  Colonel of cavalry and nothing more, for there was nothing left to him beyond that.  Nor for Sheridan either.  But with Sheridan there was a flamboyant touch in mustache and chin whisker, of no depth in their gesture, that the saber blade of his fine nose didn't throw the laugh to.</p>
<p>  He said, "Massarene, I'm bringing you an order.  I'm giving it to you personally.  I'm sending you across the Rio Grande after the Lipans, Kickapoos, and the Apaches.  I'm tired of hit and run, and diplomatic hide and seek.  Cross the border and burn 'em out, and to high hell with the Department of State!"</p>
<p>  "Mr. Topliff," Massarene said, "you didn't hear that . . . except officially.  Which is not hearing it at all."</p>
<p>  Outside, the recruits from Jefferson Barracks were unloading baggage with the dogged sullenness of early morning, thumping it down to the ground, cursing softly, getting the job done, but with no joy in it.</p>
<p>  "Do I have a written order for the mission, general?"  Massarene asked.</p>
<p>  "No."  Phil Sheridan shook his head.  "Grant and I will take personal responsibility in Washington, but we want no official paper record to exist.  My job is to protect Texas.  You cross the Rio Grande and smash 'em, Massarene, as Mackenzie smashed 'em!"</p>
<p>  Outside, with the wagon train unloaded and the gray first light loping across the prairie like the shadow of a gaunt wolf, Sergeant Shattuck began calling the roll of the replacement detail, "Andrews, Blake, Cattlett, Fink--"</p>
<p>  Inside, General Sheridan said, "Too bad about your son, Massarene."</p>
<p>  "I beg your pardon, sir?"</p>
<p>  "Being found, I mean.  Dismissed from the Academy."</p>
<p>  "--Heinze, Hooker, Ives, Jacobs--"</p>
<p>  "I still don't understand you, general."</p>
<p>  "Your son was dismissed from West Point two months ago.  Hadn't you heard?"</p>
<p>  Headquarters was cold suddenly with the tomb's breath, and the years that had passed over the colonel began to flow suddenly back toward him.</p>
<p>  He said, "I have had no news of my son, general, since he was three years old.  And I never expect to hear anything about him again--"</p>
<p>  "--Lowry, Lutz, Marble, Massarene--"</p>
<p>  No one of the three in headquarters moved an eye but it was if the living fiber of Colonel Massarene had been belly-kicked--as if a shadow, fast moving, had flicked him with physical force.</p>
<p>  After a moment, he said, "I shall move out with the regiment, general, at reveille, the day after tomorrow. . . .  Mr. Topliff, knock out the adjutant at once."  But the sound that hung in the room was the echo of that name "Massarene," like a dead man's coat on a peg.</p>
<p>  The news ran through the regiment before morning stable call: "One of the new recruits from Jefferson is the Old Man's son!  He failed in mathematics and they kicked him out of the Academy.  He enlisted the same day at Highland Falls."  And at breakfast in the bachelor officers' mess: "His mother was one of the Fahnestock sisters.  Unbelievably beautiful.  And the youngster is as handsome as sin, with the Old Man's wiriness.  She couldn't take the life, they say.  Had her own money.  Left Massarene years ago, when he was a lieutenant."</p>
<p>  When D'Arcy Topliff spotted the paymaster's wagon and inspected the escort for Sheridan's trip to Elkhorn, the general thanked him.</p>
<p>  Then as he climbed in, he turned his head.  "You married, mister?"</p>
<p>  Topliff smiled.  "That's hard to come by out here, general."</p>
<p>  "When you come by it," Sheridan said, "see that it's an Army girl.  One that can cook, sew, ride, shoot, breed and keep her complexion, And remember, I told you, mister."</p>
<p>  The men joked about putting chevrons on at Starke with hooks and eyes.  They hated Colonel Massarene because he hewed so close to the line that no humanity ever got between, only an immaculate military justice that was machine-made, and as icy as the fingers of death.  They hated him because he was ever right, and they hated him because they knew they could never love him.  "God, I hope the boy has steel; for the Old Man will break him in his two hands, if he hasn't it!"</p>
<p>  When Colonel Massarene inspected the recruit detail, he looked straight into his son's eyes, but there was no recognition in either man, no wavering.</p>
<p>  "I hope the blood of every one of you ran thick down your legs in the Jefferson riding ring," the Old Man said to the detail.  "I hope you're all dry of it, except in your hearts.  Desert . . . and I'll find you and rope you and bring you back.  Go slack in your duties . . . and I'll stiffen your spines against escort-wagon wheels.  In this regiment, it is harder to make corporal than it is for a Hindoo to get into heaven.  You're for company duty as of today. . . .  Dismiss the detail."  And he turned on his heel and walked off.</p>
<p>  After guard mount, when Topliff marched off as O.G., the Old Man sent for him to come to headquarters.  "Mr. Topliff," he said, "only you and I know where the regiment is going.  That's enough tongues to leak it.  So we'll have no more tongues--not even the adjutant's--in on it.  Chart me three alternate routes.  Roughly, I want to move southwest from Starke to the Tablelands, as a diversion, and I want to cross the border somewhere between Peco and San Jacinto by forced night march, leaving the escort wagons behind.  The moon is dark in nine days.  I'll cross then and I'd like very well to have the regiment think it was crossing the Querhada River, rather than the Rio Grande. . . . until the last possible minute.  I suppose you understand you may resign your commission?  Should General Sheridan die in the midst of this, you'll lose it, and I'll lose mine . . . and everyone else."</p>
<p>  "You don't intend to offer resignation to the other officers, sir.  You only mention it to me because I was present and know the mission?"</p>
<p>  "An order, Mr. Topliff, is an order.  I cannot offer it to the others until the Rio Grande is crossed, and then I will not."</p>
<p>  Working out the lines of march, D'Arcy Topliff was in the outer office of headquarters when Private Massarene came in.  He heard the interview, and it was like the pounding of short in-blows through the partition.</p>
<p>  "You sent for me, sir?"</p>
<p>  "I did."  And a long pause that writhed in the air as the eyes of those two met and whipped at each other like knives.  "I sent for you to put it to you straight.  That you are my son is merely a matter of official record.  For years you have undoubtedly lived with a concept of me, as I have of you.  I shall give you my concept of you.  It is not pleasant.  There are two blood streams coursing in you.  One is deeply ingrained in a way of soft and moneyed living--so deeply that pride of oath and commitment is secondary to its continued necessity.  That is on your record."</p>
<p>  Outside, Topliff could feel in his own cheeks the hot rush of angry blood darkening the boy's handsome face until the lips became white as a new scar.  And in his mind Topliff whispered frantically, Don't answer him.  Don't talk back.</p>
<p>  "And it is on your record, too, that you have failed at West Point and been turned out as unfit for a commission.  So you have enlisted, in a dramatic gesture, to lacerate yourself by showing your carbine to men you have hazed.  Neither the failure nor the attempt to atone for it impresses me.  Your other blood stream is mine, but your concept of that is a concept of plumes, parades, and band music.  Following the lie of their lure, you have rashly and thoughtlessly placed your living upon the tabletop, and the cards are dealt.  I put it to you flatly, that the royal straight flush of glory never comes up in life, and that only fools hope for it.  My father shot, for cowardice, at Chapultepec, the officer son of a United States senator with his own hand.  I shall not bedevil you, but what comes to other men will only come to you in this regiment through a meticulous, immaculate performance of duty up to the last detail.  You have chosen my way of life; I shall see that you attain to it unto its deepest essence or leave your bones to bleach under the prairie moon!"</p>
<p>  Topliff, outside, realized that his own hands were clenched so tightly that his arms ached to the elbows.  It was the boy's voice--low, even and controlled, like flicked gloves.</p>
<p>  "Do I . . . have the privilege of speaking, sir . . . or do I not?"</p>
<p>  "Within the strict limitations of decorum."</p>
<p>  "I didn't ask to be sent to this regiment, sir, but I wouldn't have it otherwise, now that I'm here.  Except for one thing."</p>
<p>  "And what is that one thing?"</p>
<p>  Young Massarene said, "That there might be any faint thought in your mind, sir, that I came to this regiment ever to call you 'father.'"</p>
<p>  Jasper!  What life can do to people at times, and so uselessly, so wholly without reason.</p>
<p>  Young Massarene went to C Company for duty--Lieutenant Cohill's company--but as the way is with things like that, once you've been let in on the inside track, D'Arcy Topliff kept crossing the boy's trail.  A lean youngster, lithe and flat in the hips, deep-chested.  Loading the regimental escort wagons behind the commissary corral.  On the ammunition detail.  Post fatigue detachments.  Stables.  And Topliff watched him closely to see what was there, for there could have been many wrong things.</p>
<p>  Because Topliff had gone over to the youngster's side instinctively, when the colonel had flayed him, he stayed over.  And without knowing quite how, a part of him got into young Massarene's mind, just as a part of him had got into the colonel's mind when he had heard that violin at four in the morning.</p>
<p>  The regiment moved out on schedule and took the long trail down into the southwest country.  And sometimes in the days that followed, D'Arcy Topliff rode as young Massarene.  Sometimes he rode as the colonel.  He was young Massarene when they found the burned-out wagon train and the dead wagoners, with one strapped face downward to a wagon shaft with his tongue cut out, but still alive to the horror of writhing ants.  Young Massarene, with the bitter bile in his throat, swallowing eternally to keep his food down against the green corruption in his nostrils.  White gloves and pipeclayed cross belts.  Varnished boots and brass buttons in the Hudson River sunlight.  Another world away from Sergeant Shattuck, drawing his revolver carefully and putting it in the wagoner's agonized hand.  Picking it up again from where it whipped to, in jerking recoil, from the lone shot that brought peace.</p>
<p>  But Topliff was the colonel in his mind, when the smoke was high beyond the head of the column, when they rode slowly down into Corinth Wells to the burned-out houses.  Women were dead in the yards, and there was a 12-year-old girl with her mind gone completely and forever to her torn nakedness.  "Someone please give me a drink of water and tell me a funny story."</p>
<p>  "Cohill," Colonel Massarene said, "take the pursuit.  I'll give you 12 hours.  Twenty men.  Meet me"--he put his finger on his map--"here, at San Jacinto."  And Topliff felt it in Colonel Massarene's mind before the colonel said it.  Felt it for what the colonel's thinking was, for it is easy to steady recruits with action, but it is the hard way to make them see, and not lash back.  It is easy to temper their anger with hot carbines, but it is merciless to hold them in close restraint.  And nothing is worse than burying women the Apaches have worked over; nothing is worse than an insane girl digging down again to her mother's dead face in the starlight.</p>
<p>  "Don't take the detail from C Company, Mr. Cohill.  Take the pickets.  And under no circumstances cross the Rio Grande," the colonel said.</p>
<p>  Cohill didn't run the hostiles down.  They were across the Rio Grande before he hit the river line.  Across, as they always were now, safe in formal protocol, reeking with drying blood in the green smoke of their villages, under the theoretic protection of a wreck of empire that had sprawled in disorder since the breeze of Queretaro whipped at the blue smoke of the firing party's rifles and ruffled the blond beard of Maximilian von Habsburg, dead in the dust that rose about his riddled body.</p>
<p>  "Don't take the detail from C Company, Mr. Cohill."</p>
<p>  So it was for days, as Massarene moved the regiment steadily along.  Then presently the regiment was a bad joke to itself--a slow-moving buffoon with the clowns who got the laughs, slapsticking in behind it to strike and dashing up ahead to grimace in derision.  Almost they seemed to watch from the other side, time the regiment's march and plan their forays to fit the pattern.</p>
<p>  Anger burned deep as bowel pain, and still Massarene held the regiment in his two gray hands, watching it as a surgeon watches sickness, listening to its faintest curse and the wirepulled shadow of agner in faces.  It was as if the regiment were a single man to him--Topliff's mind again--a man he would condition by withholding water, by making him sweat in the forced night marches, by shortening rations to empty his belly for the scalpel, by toning his animal instinct to face the shock of the cutting edge.  "Under no circumstances will you cross the Rio Grande."</p>
<p>  The regiment went cold and silent under the treatment, sullen to a point of meticulous fury in performance.  Quick animal fights in the bivouacs, put down quickly with harder fists; and the horses had it, too, in their souls--hoof lashings on the picket ropes, soft and angry screams.  And still, like a surgeon, Massarene watched it to the final moment.  Then he rolled up his sleeves and strapped on his rubber apron and reached for the scalpel.</p>
<p>  He bivouacked early that afternoon and grazed wide on the picket pins.  He inspected personally--like a pup lieutenant on his first detail to the guard.  He fed a hot meal.  He made a double ammunition issue, and one short ration and a cantle-roll oat issue, and suddenly, through the command, the thinking was like the cocking of a piece on a frosty night--leaping question--a cold threat--a resurgence that turned the anger from white to crimson.</p>
<p>  When the first darkness came down, Colonel Massarene stood to horse, on passed voice order.  No water, except on official order.  No unauthorized eating or feeding.  No advance guard.  No flank guards.  No trumpet calls.  Nothing but a long column closely knit, cased in discipline, poised for a javelin cast into the night.</p>
<p>  "Mount."</p>
<p>  A quick reversal of the day's direction of march, a quick doubling-back at a tangent toward the south and east, and at half past eleven that night: "Jasper!"--through the column--This ain't the Querhada!  This is the Rio Grande!"  And there it was, with its saffron waters cutting the dust of the march like a double-bitted ax blade holding it high over the United States while the regiment forded across, in the cold inertia of its movement--forded across and stood sweatdank under the stars while the Old Man called in his officers.</p>
<p>  "Gentlemen," he said, "the direction of march is south by west, magnetic, to Santa Maria.  I'm burning out everything in my path-everything Kickapoo, Lipan, and Apache, and anything else that the darkness fails to distinguish.  I'm going through like a scourge-in column at the gallop, so that the next five hours will be remembered for 20 years to come.  If I'm opposed by troops, I'm still going through, for a recrossing at Paredes at six a.m.  You will leave your dead, shoot wounded horses, and lash your wounded in their saddles.  There will be no dismounted action."  And then he said the one thing he had to say while his hatred of the necessity twisted across his gray face and left its bitter taste upon his lips:  "Gentlemen, I am operating under orders.  You are operating under my orders.  You need, therefore, have no thought for the consequences of tonight's work.  That will be thrashed out thousands of miles away by men who wear clean clothing and sit in comfortable offices."  And then he did it, as coldly as the drawing of a saber: "Mr. Cohill, screen me to the southward at a thousand yards' distance and cut me a pathway.  Mr. Cohill, take C Company."</p>
<p>  There it is.  No easy first commitment, no racing fight in daylight across your own terrain with reserves behind you and surgeons to stop your bone-broken screaming.  No, you'll watch that from the sidewalk.  But this is different.  If your mount goes down on this, you're done to get back, unless you catch a free mount.  You're out ahead, in this fight, for first contact in darkness, for ambush and barricades, and a burst of tearing fire from shadows.  If you're hit, you're done, unless a bunkie ties you on.  If you break, Cohill will shoot you like a dog.  And if you are a hero, no one will see it in the darkness for a cheap reward.  "Mr. Cohill, screen me to the southward at a thousand yards' distance and cut me a pathway.  Mr. Cohill, take C Company."  But the words Topliff seemed to hear were not those words; they were the other ones: "or leave your bones to bleach under the prairie moon."</p>
<p>  Strangely, as C Company moved out under Flint Cohill's low word of command, there were not hoofs and creaking leather in it, not shirt sweat and horse dung, but the faint rustle of silken skirts and jasmine on the night air, and the quiet sobbing of a woman, echoing down the lost years.</p>
<p>  Topliff saw young Massarene's face as he passed by in the darkness, for there was starlight in the river wash- saw it briefly.  Handsome as sin, but a man's face, and a man's body moving in easy oneness with his mount.  Only between that and the colonel's face there was a subtlety of difference that was more than years-linen cuffs instead of wool.  The turned-up collar of the duelist instead of gray eyes along open sights.  Laughter warming the cold word, for humanity.  The stamina of insouciance to face a mistake with a fillip and work it down the hard way to a rightful place once more, on the wings of ancient blood.</p>
<p>  Harder that way by far, than the ruthless runway of a lifetime of discipline.  Don't try too hard, boy, Topliff's mind whispered.  And the knowledge was on Topliff that there are ways of life for all of us and no man dare criticize another for the pathway that fits his feet, for it is a lonely journey always, and God speaks many tongues.</p>
<p>  "Lead out!"</p>
<p>  Well, it is now in the books-impersonally, with the date and the fact-but it is left there suspended in midair, for two laws crossed each other and diplomacy is manner, not morality.  But see the repirsal raid for a red beast in the night, clawing on a 47-mile arc of the world like the devil in white-hot armor.  See the spoor of dead in its pathway, hacked open and gaping, and the crimson flowers of flame that burst against the darkness and guttered in the echo of ruthless hoofs.</p>
<p>  The breathing in men's throats was drawn wire, tearing at membranes, and there were fear and murder and hope in their minds until they were as raw as clawed flesh.</p>
<p>  But one mind wasn't.  "topliff, get after Pennell to close up!  Close up!"  One mind frozen to the machine, one mind holding it to the job.  Even if it vibrated from its bed, it wouldn't cast loose.  Lash it.  Hold it true.  Grab it and keep it functioning even if it tears the fingers from your hands.  "Tell Pennell, I'll try him.  Tell him I'll shoot him, damn him, if he separates.  Keep the column closed up--closed up!"</p>
<p>  Seven villages they burned out--Lipan, Kickapoo, and Apache--hitting them out of the night on the exact positions the colonel's authenticated information had placed them.  Coming down like an avalanche from the darkness, leaving nothing behind but the wail of women, halting each time to reform briefly and take up the inexorable march at the walk, and then presently at the trot, and then again, "Right front into line! Gallop! Yo!" all the way to Escobedo, and there in the last darkness and the cold river mists-with the end of it in sight-the word had gone on ahead on the wings of the flames behind or on instinct, and C Company hit the barricade and the running fire that defended it.  Horses were down, shrieking in agony, and the command bunched in on itself in the roadway and a ricochet sent the chapel bell tolling brieftly overhead.  Flames burst high and made the whole thing clear for just a second--not actually to see at the time, but to remember long afterward.</p>
<p>  Red knife cuts laced across the night and 'dobe dust spat from the lashed walls.  The regiment crushed in on C Company, debouching right and left around the chapel to keep its momentum, dividing--"Go through, Cohill!  Damn you, go through!"  And Cohill, with his face covered with blood in the flames and white-streaked in dust, a centaur on his bunched horse, leaped over and screamed to C to follow him.</p>
<p>  Someone was thrashing in the roadway, his horse down, flaying at him with pain-crazed hoofs-thrashing and screaming, "Mother!Mother!" as they will.</p>
<p>  Topliff was knee to knee with the colonel when the other rider cut in front of them, bent low at the gallop and grabbed the man's thrown-up arm, wrenching him to his dragging feet, pulling him to his pommel, just as his own horse pitched forward, throwing both of them to the chapel steps, head over.  With one hand young Massarene still held the man he had rescued.  With the other he began to fire steadily into the firing, like a man on the pistol range, squeezing off enenly, his handsome lips drawn back in the firelight.</p>
<p>  Colonel Massarene threw up his own mount, turned him on his heels and raced back into the murderous firing to a free horse-raced back to the chapel steps.</p>
<p>  "Mount, Donald, you fool!" and his son threw on, dragging his bunkie up again.</p>
<p>  "Thank you, sir"-as cold as a word passed at whist, not studied, not controlled, but the voice of the man himself-of a competent journeyman, working well at his trade.</p>
<p>  Then it was, as the three of them galloped knee to knee, that Topliff heard the bullet strike the Old Man like a rock hurled into mud.  Then it was also that he saw young Massarene's shoulder and upper arm torn clean open to the white bones, for the mesquite bushes stood outlined now against the racing dawn.</p>
<p>  The colonel was down close to his mount's neck, sweat-drenched and worn thin and broken with pain, but he kept at the gallop until he reached the head of the column and halted it to reform.  Then he said, "Mr. Topliff, I can't dismount.  Rope me in the saddle."</p>
<p>  Topliff tied one of his feet and young Massarene passed the halter under his horse and tied the other foot.</p>
<p>  "You're hurt", the colonel said to the boy suddenly Topliff knew that the lost years no longer stood between those two like grinning beggars with their hungry hands held out for alms.  The essence of affinity was there, as it had always been.  The handsome face beside the gray one-that was like a finer metal stamped from the same coin press.</p>
<p>  "That doesn't matter, does it, sir?"</p>
<p>  And in the broad light of day there was the feeling of soft white hands on D'Arcy Topliff-hands touching him gratefully for his understanding, because what D'Arcy heard was:  I'm sorry, but all my life I knew I would have to show you someday that she wasn't as wrong as you cared to believe her; that I'd have to come out here and prove it to you in the only way that you could ever understand, father.</p>
<p>  And the reason Topliff heard those words was that young Massarene grinned when he said, "That doesn't matter, does it, sir?"</p>
<p>  The regiment recrossed the Rio Grandle at Paredes at six a.m. Colonel Massarene was the last man over, riding between his son and Lieutenant Topliff, lashed still in his saddle.</p>
<p>  "Mr. Topliff, pass the word to Major Allshard to take over command. Donald, turn in to the regimental surgeon for that arm, and rejoin your company.  When the surgeon is finished with the wounded, send him along, I'll wait here for the excort wagons.  Untie me and let me down."</p>
<p>  Topliff untied the halter and slid the colonel out of his saddle.  Young Massarene, half-circling his mount on the forehand, saluted with his bridle hand, for the other arm was useless, and bowed slightly into the salute.  There was infinite grace in the gesture and a gentleness of finer living.</p>
<p>  The colonel, one hand pressed tightly into his torn side, returned the courtesy, and whatever stain lay between those two was washed clean.  The years they had lost were forgotten and the debt was paid in full.</p>
